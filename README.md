# Interval_Regression

**`Interval_Regression`** is created for adjust `MapieRegressor` to scikit-learn regression design in order to easy deployment.   
To access `MapieRegressor`, please see: 'https://mapie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html'  

`MapieRegressor` enables to find lower and upper bounds of predictions with an alpha value for selected estimator algorithm.  
For example, for `alpha = 0.1`, `MapieRegressor` can find the prediction interval with 90% probability.
